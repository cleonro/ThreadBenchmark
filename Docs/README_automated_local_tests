Pyhton scripts for local tests need the following environment variables
    
        LOCAL_BIN_PATH - path to directory that contains ThreadBenchmark executable
        LOCAL_TEST_DIRECTORY - directory under the python "local watcher": files that are copied / created here trigger events handled with ThreadBenchmark
        
Files copied / created in LOCAL_TEST_DIRECTORY have the following syntax:

- First line should contain only this string: THREAD_BENCHMARK_TEST_FILE
- Each of the following lines must contain two parameters for running ThreadBenchmark (resource size and thread count)

Example of test files (see provided file in Tests directory):
THREAD_BENCHMARK_TEST_FILE
20000000 1
20000000 2
20000000 3
