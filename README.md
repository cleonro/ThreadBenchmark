# ThreadBenchmark
This is a tool that is used as a very simple benchmark for multithreading efficiency. The main instrument is ThreadBenchmark program built on Unix platforms from C++ sources. It is used like:
ThreadBenchmark resourceSize threadCount

The output shows the duration necessary to obtain a certain result, using the provided threadCount number of threads.

The tests are automatized with the Python scrips in the project.
